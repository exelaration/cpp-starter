# C++ Starter Application

Bootstraps a simple C++ application using `CMake` and `GoogleTest`.  To get started, clone the code and replace `**PROJECT_NAME**` in `CMakeLists.txt` and `test/CMakeLists.txt` with the appropriate value for your project.

This project is setup to optionally take advantage of Docker/Podman and the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) Visual Studio Code extension to run within a development container.
